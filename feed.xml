        <title>Planning In Uncertainty</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, I have attended 3 or 4 Release Train Planning (RTP) meetings. In these meetings, the entire team came together and planned out the next release. A release is roughly a three month period, made up of 6 two-week iterations. The way these meetings are run is that the objective of a given release is introduced by a business representative and teams break down the work into stories which are mapped against the 6 iterations. All the teams taking part in the release then come back together to present their plan, synchronize it with the other teams and commit to results and dates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rigidity of this ritual struck me as odd. When the mics were off, people spoke about these plans and the fact that they always change anyway as the deadline approaches. No real surprise there. The odd thing was that everybody went along, put effort into a plan, re-jigged it to line up with another teams plan, and then committed to delivering this fine master-piece of Gantt charts. All in a 3-day effort by about 50 or 60 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody somewhere must have left those RTP feeling happy and confident in the plans. But knowing that future plans have an increasing chance of not coming to fruition, that time spent planning could have been spent elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty is an important factor when planning. Not only is there uncertainty on how to execute a given task, but there is also uncertainty on whether to execute it at all.
What needs to happen before it, or whether it needs to be re-thought. Let’s put the uncertainty on a graph against the time we intend to execute on the plans:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/doubt-and-plans.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Plans made for the distant future have more uncertainty&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plans made for the next couple of days are fairly certain, while plans for things months from now are pretty much anyone’s guess.  Think about the last 5-6 months of your last project: requirements changed, deadlines moved, earlier tasks unearthed a new set of challenges or unexpected opportunities. All of this will put your perfectly drawn Gantt chart out of whack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s return to the RTP, where we planned our next 4-5 months of development, cramming each iteration with stories until they are full. The image below shows a fictional team board, with the necessary stories for the next 6 iterations, overlayed by a red line showing the increasing doubts as plans are further in the future:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/doubt-story-board.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Stories within a  release, with the doubt overlayed&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The color coding should show how at risk these stories are. From the top left (urgent and critical) in blue to the bottom right (neither urgent nor important) in red. The yellow stories are somewhere in between. An interesting observation is that the top story in iteration 3 is blue, while the third and fourth stories in iteration 2 are yellow. The blue story in iteration 3 is going to be the highest priority in that iteration, while the other two yellow ones are a low priority, meaning they could be dropped or changed. Now keep in mind, we are still planning ahead. We have not completed any of the stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The uncertainty lines help us in deciding whether there is value in planning stories underneath it. It helps us focus on the right now of the important tasks, rather than spending precious time planing future stories, let alone future unimportant stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how should we plan? Many, many, many small plans for a near-future horizon. Concentrating the entire planning into three days for 4 months is a recipe for disaster. There is no wiggle-room. No space for learning. No space for adjusting. Too many wheels are in motion and too many interdependencies are in play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the effect of many smaller plannings clearer, let’s see how they fare with the uncertainty. The next image shows three simplified views of the board, once before the first, second, and third iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/multiple-iterations-planning.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Smaller, more frequent iteration plannings.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the planning horizon was kept short: next iteration and a story or two for the iterations after that. Only the current iteration was packed with stories. All other iterations were left with some space, giving the team some breathing room to react to new information. Important stories or features which the team had to address at some point (important, but not urgent) were put on the board, but their iterations definitely not filled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is tempting to go for the &lt;em&gt;big plan&lt;/em&gt;. To lay out all the cards on the table. To get everybody together, and for once get everybody to agree to a plan &lt;em&gt;and stick to it&lt;/em&gt;. Sadly, the underlying closed-world assumptions (we know all the facts in advance) rarely holds true. Smaller, more frequent plans give you the necessary freedom to change direction. To adjust and react to new events. I urge you to give it a try. The beauty of trying this idea: if it doesn’t work out for you, you have at most lost an iteration or two, instead of an entire release. Isn’t that something worth trying?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hashtag Impostor Syndrome</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I came to a realization today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I feel greater impostor syndrome on Twitter than at home or the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me fill in some context. In the last weeks, we have begun training an employee to become a “craftsmanship coach”. The idea is that he will work with us to learn values of craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once our engagement has ended, he will be the driving factor pushing the company forward. As part of that &lt;em&gt;apprenticeship&lt;/em&gt; that employee will be writing code, giving talks and writing blogs. That prompted me to resurrect my personal blog and try to engage more with the internet. I intend to do so by writing on this blog, going to meetups and events, and post my ideas on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was about to tweet out a sketch of an idea about ‘iteration planning’ it hit me: I was afraid of putting a prominent #hashtag on it. I was unsure whether my idea was right, new, or good. What would people think? Who am I to Big-Important-Hashtags on my little tweet and claim relevance? Here is the tweet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Sketch on &amp;quot;Why &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/planning?src=hash&quot;&gt;#planning&lt;/a&gt; beyond a horizon adds little value&amp;quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/openlearning?src=hash&quot;&gt;#openlearning&lt;/a&gt; cc &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AntonyMarcano&quot;&gt;@AntonyMarcano&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Cj0Mr2t2VV&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Cj0Mr2t2VV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Felipe Sere (@felipesere) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/felipesere/status/824393103968706560&quot;&gt;January 25, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to tweet with a #hashtag which a friend of mine had mentioned in a similar tweet of his: #openlearning. That #hashtag made me feel easier about the tweet. It was a learning experience. If someone looked the tweet, took the time to reply to it, then I’d sure get even more value and learning from it. My idea did not need to be perfect to share it on the internet. The input from other people would help me refine it and allow me to strike a conversation with peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23openlearning&amp;amp;src=typd&quot;&gt;#openlearning&lt;/a&gt; tweet might gain more traction and the  discussion around it will be fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fast feedback with RSpec and rerun</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CharlotteBRF/status/824251562428076034&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; tweet scrolled across my time-line about using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--fail-fast&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Super blog from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nikeshashar&quot;&gt;@nikeshashar&lt;/a&gt; on failing fast with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/RSpec?src=hash&quot;&gt;#RSpec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/PZF3tXulay&quot;&gt;https://t.co/PZF3tXulay&lt;/a&gt; ..all those &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/codewars&quot;&gt;@codewars&lt;/a&gt;  tests feel worth it! cc &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/felipesere&quot;&gt;@felipesere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dr Charlotte Fereday (@CharlotteBRF) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CharlotteBRF/status/824251562428076034&quot;&gt;January 25, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--fail-fast&lt;/code&gt; with RSpec means the very first failure that RSpec encounters will halt the entire suite.
Passing tests give a sense achievement, but failing tests show where more work is needed.
Furthermore, getting many cascading failures (indicative of a potential design issue!) are distracting and overwhelming.
Using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--fail-fast&lt;/code&gt; limits the amount of failures we need to concentrate at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is more.
Switching between your editor and terminal, followed by running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rspec --fail-fast&lt;/code&gt; (potentailly hitting up-arrow multiple times) adds
an additional context switch and is distracting. I catch myself “over-tabbing” to my twitter timeline in Chrome every once in a while, just saying.
What if we didn’t have to manually run our tests?
Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexch/rerun&quot;&gt;rerun&lt;/a&gt;.
Install it with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;   gem install rerun
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  rerun -cx &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;rspec --fail-fast
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s decompose that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;-c will clear the screen, so you are not distracted by previous successes/failures&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;-x expect rspec to ‘exit’, meaning we know its a one-shot command and not a server (that needs to halted)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of ways to improve this even further.
For example, if you install &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier&quot;&gt;terminal-notifier&lt;/a&gt; then you can have notifications
pop up in the notification center. This is nice if you work in Sublime or Atom and you feel like you’d loose too much screen space
by having a command line open in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another cool parameter is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-p &quot;**/*.something&quot;&lt;/code&gt; which lets you watch for certain files.
Rerun is setup to watch for common files (Ruby, SCSS, JS, and some others),
but it is happy to work with any pattern you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you go, have &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rerun&lt;/code&gt; run your tests for you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Walking down the path again</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided to start blogging again.
Not about anything in particular or for any particular audience.
Just for me to gather my thoughts on things around code and craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
